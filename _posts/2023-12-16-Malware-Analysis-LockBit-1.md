### Target

The ransomware LockBit 2.0 examines user and system configurations. By configuring the language to specific languages, the system remains unaffected by the attack. The following is a list of languages that LockBit 2.0 does not target:     

- Armenian   
- Azeri (Latin, Cyrillic)   
- Belarusian    
- Georgian    
- Kazakh (Cyrillic)    
- Kyrgyz (Cyrillic)    
- Turkmen    
- Uzbek (Latin, Cyrillic)    
- Russian    

### Technical Overview

LockBit employs a hybrid cryptographic approach, combining Libsodium's `XSalsa20-Poly1305-Blake2b-Curve25519` and `AES-128-CBC` for file encryption. The configuration of the malware is encrypted using `XOR` and stored in static memory.     

With the elaborated multithreading architecture, LockBitâ€™s performance is relatively fast compared to most ransomware in the field.     

LockBit 2.0 encrypts the victim's files and appends the `.lockbit` extension subsequent to execution. LockBit 2.0 notifies the victim of the successful completion of the attack by modifying the desktop wallpaper and appending the ransom note `Restore-My-Files.txt`.
